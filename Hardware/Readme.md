### Main Hardware Components

- ESP32 Development Board
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- ToF Distance Sensor
- Vibration Sensor
- IMU Sensor
- GPS Module
- GSM Module
- Motor Driver
- DC Gear Motors
- Robot Chassis
- Camera Module
- Battery Supply

### Hardware Architecture

The ESP32 collects real-time data from the connected sensors and transmits the processed information to the Flask-based monitoring dashboard through Wi-Fi.

The camera module captures track images, which are processed using image-processing techniques for potential crack detection.
